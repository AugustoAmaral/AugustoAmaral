## About me

I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, currently working with Three60 Energy/Maiella building complex dashboards for the oil & gas industry. Check out the [FACTS Dashboard](https://apps.energyops.io/facts/) - one of those projects that actually turned out better than the initial mockups (yes, it happens sometimes).

**🎯 Currently open to new opportunities** - Looking for challenging roles where I can contribute to meaningful projects with talented teams.

## What I've been up to

### 🛢️ At Three60 Energy/Maiella
Achieved something that usually only exists in developer dreams: **90%+ code coverage** that actually makes sense. Built an automated visual testing framework with Storybook and Playwright that compares screenshots pixel by pixel.

Together with our architect, we designed the entire frontend using **Vite** and **Bun runtime**. If you're curious about the performance gains and cost savings, I wrote about it [in this article](https://zoolatech.com/blog/unlocking-ci-cost-efficiency-with-bun-in-large-scale-projects/).

### 🏗️ At Procore (via Zoolatech)
Navigating a 20-year-old codebase taught me patience is indeed a virtue. Worked on their flagship construction management platform, delivering critical features for budget management while modernizing legacy Rails and React code. The kind of experience where you learn that `// TODO: fix this later` comments from 2008 are still there for a reason.

### 🚀 My startup journey (Avaliei!)
Won Hacking.Rio 2019 (out of 700+ participants) and turned it into a venture-backed startup with Vibra Energia S.A. as our partner. Built everything from scratch - the tech stack, the team, the late-night debugging sessions. It didn't work out in the end, but the experience? Priceless.

## Tech Stack

**Daily drivers:**
- TypeScript
- React
- Ruby on Rails
- Python
- Node.js

**Current favorites:**
- Bun
- Storybook
- TanStack Router
- Moon
- Elysia + Eden Treaty

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**
- Docker
- GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps
- AWS

## Things I've built

### [FACTS Dashboard](https://apps.energyops.io/facts/)
Interactive data visualization dashboard for the energy industry. The real challenge here was creating complex AND/OR filters that users could actually understand without a manual. Built with React, TypeScript, and ECharts.

### [Blog: Cutting CI Costs with Bun](https://zoolatech.com/blog/unlocking-ci-cost-efficiency-with-bun-in-large-scale-projects/)
Wrote about how teams can significantly reduce CI costs and build times using Bun.

### Automated Visual Testing Framework
Custom Storybook + Playwright solution that captures and compares screenshots across multiple viewports and themes.

### End-to-End Type Safety System
Implemented Elysia + Eden Treaty architecture eliminating those fun runtime surprises when the backend changes the API without telling anyone. Full type safety from database to UI

## Let's connect

I'm always interested in discussing new opportunities, interesting technical challenges, or just chatting about why we keep adding more JavaScript frameworks to the ecosystem.
